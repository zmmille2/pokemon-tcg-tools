# Custom Pokemon Card Generator Script

I made this for my own personal use, so it's not the most polished thing in the world.
If I've used something of yours and you'd like me to remove it, please contact me and I will be happy to do so.

## Making Cards

See [DEVELOPER.md](./DEVELOPER.md)

## Rules

tl;dr
We'll play on Tabletop Simulator.
If you want to make cards, read below and see how.
The rules on the game and the draft are below, reference those if you want to know how this is going to work.

Let's have a pokemon card game tournament.

1. RULES

Given the size of our small group, I think the format will be round robin.
We'll be using this rulebook:

https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms/pdf/tcg/rulebooks/Black_White_Rulebook.pdf

With the following changes:
If both players win at the same time, the game is a tie.
All x2 weaknesses are +20 instead.
All -30 resistances are -20 instead.

2. DRAFT

We're going to be playing draft mode:
Each player will start with 15 packs of cards from the set we're using.
You have infinite access to energy cards.
From this, you need to create a deck of 60 cards exactly.
You have 15 minutes to do so.

Sets will be best of 3 games.
Each game won will earn you 1 more pack, and each loss will earn you 5 more packs.
If you and your opponent tie, you'll each earn 3 more packs.
In between games, you'll have 7 minutes to make changes to your deck.

After each set, you'll keep your deck the other cards you've pulled, so adapt!
